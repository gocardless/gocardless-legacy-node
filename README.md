# GoCardless Node.js client library

__This API library is only for developers who already have an integration using the [Legacy GoCardless API](https://developer.gocardless.com/legacy).__

If you're starting a new integration, we don't currently have a JavaScript library, but you can integrate using the [REST API](https://developer.gocardless.com).

If you're not sure whether this is the right library for you, get in touch - you can reach our developer support team at <api@gocardless.com>.

If you're sure this is the library you want to be using, see [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) for documentation and helpful resources.
